# Kubejs CopyPaste Tool
(Minecraft) Copy Paste method using only Kubejs

### DONT USE IT ENABLE ON YOUR SURVIVAL WORLD!

## How To Use:
- Pickup a `blazerod` [template item] and select with holding shiftkey corners of your structure
  
  *if you press chat coords it will visualize a `Block-Display` [1.20.only] , to remove them you need to use a `flint` [template item]

- After selected all corners you need to `right click` on it and you can see some `fancy particles` and a `title` that see you the schematic with own UUID

- To paste you need [due kubejs security limitation] to edit the file `/server_scripts/build.js` changing the uuid on variable `url` with what you want paste

- After that  you can save and come back in game to paste it

- To execute it [by default] you can `right click` with a `stick` [template item] on a `bedrock` and the schematic can be placed
